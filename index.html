                <!-- Drow Ranger bio reference is from https://dota2.gamepedia.com/Drow_Ranger -->
                <p> Traxex, the Drow Ranger, is a ranged agility hero whose greatest assets are her incredible damage
                    and ability to keep threats at bay. Traxex is a carry who, though lacking survivability, provides a
                    worthwhile contribution through her damage alone. </p>
                <p>
                    As an agility hero, Traxex's damage is based largely on her basic attacks and is among the greatest
                    largely due to the massive amounts of bonus proc damage she gains from her passive ultimate,
                    Marksmanship, which also provides bonus Agility to nearby ranged heroes.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Despite her lack of escape spells, Drow Ranger can keep herself relatively safe from enemy spellcasters and melee heroes using her Gust, Multishot, and her Frost Arrows, respectively. Frost Arrows infuses her attacks with ice, greatly slowing down her enemies. Since it can be manually cast, Frost Arrows can be used to harass her foes in the early game without drawing the creeps' attention.
